 <p>La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection. 

    <br>The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and the AOI Illustration Awards. 
    
    <br>Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland.
    
   <br> “We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca. “It's not unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.”
